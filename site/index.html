<h1>Hello Coursera!</h1>
<p>This is my test page for learning how to use GitHub to mark, commit, and push things to the site.</p>
<p>I'm also taking the opportunity to try out some of the functions of SublimeText 3. Pretty cool editor. Here's what a bulletted list looks like:</p>
<ul><li>Item 1
<li>Item 2
<li>Item3
</ul>
<p>Is it important for li tags to be closed, I wonder?</p>
